# Presterity server

The server is about as simple as it can get these days.

[Express](http://expressjs.com/) is used as the server foundation,
and maps routes to `request` objects.

Instead of using a proprietary template language
(e.g., [Pug](https://pugjs.org/) n√©e Jade),
this server uses pure [ECMAScript 6](http://es6-features.org/) functions.
Most of the UI is constructed by functions that take an Express `request`
and a [promise](http://www.datchley.name/es6-promises/)
for a text string containing HTML.
Express then serves that HTML as the `response` to the client.
